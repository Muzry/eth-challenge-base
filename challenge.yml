  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make HelloHackers() function emit Flag event

flag: flag{check in}

constructor:
  value: 1
  gas: 10000          # The default value is the response value of the eth_estimateGas JSON-RPC

show_source: False      # Show source option available by default, you need to set False for a reverse contract challenge

solved_event: Flag  # The default is to use isSolved() view function as solved checker, but emitted event checker is also supported
