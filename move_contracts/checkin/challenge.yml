  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make HelloHackers() function emit Flag event
  Attention: We deployed the SUI node's devnet-v0.27 version. Please build the SUI client on your own.

flag: flag{0xa42b74e153b78f8ccdabb2c5925ab86496e68d96}

constructor:
  value: 1
  gas: 10000          # The default value is the response value of the eth_estimateGas JSON-RPC

#show_source: False      # Show source option available by default, you need to set False for a reverse contract challenge

solved_event: Flag  # The default is to use isSolved() view function as solved checker, but emitted event checker is also supported
